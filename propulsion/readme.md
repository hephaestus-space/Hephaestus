Here you will find every data concerning the propulsion


SRM_2014.1 (1).zip is spreadsheet that takes user-inputted motor and grain geometry data and computes Kn over the duration of the motor burn, generates a pressure-time curve, a thrust-time curve, as well as performance parameters such as total impulse and delivered specific impulse. Motor performance data is also summarized for easy input into a trajectory simulation software, such as SOAR. Although primarily intended for designing motors using KN-Dextrose or KN-Sorbitol propellant, other propellants may be specified with user inputted propellant properties.
Solely for cylindrical grain configurations, such as BATES.

casing.xls is an excel preadsheet  used to determine the Design Pressure and Burst Pressure of a solid rocket motor casing. Also determines the elastic deformation of the casing under pressure (important for case-bonding consideration). Strength and mechanical properties are supplied for many casing materials such as steels, aluminum alloys, PVC, etc.
