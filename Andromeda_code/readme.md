Unfortunately we are unable to share the code of the last version of Andromeda since the school didn't wanted any legal issue.
I (Christian Ferracane) made this project scholastic back in the first months of 2021, so I need to respect the principal decisions.
Anyway we can explain, roughtly, how to build the code yourself.

P.S: if you are not very familiar with Arduino, leave this tab here, go learn it online (it's not that hard and time consuming, I promise) and come back when you feel confident enought!!
